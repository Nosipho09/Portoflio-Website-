        If you have a website or app that requires users to submit their South
        African identity number, you will definitely want to make sure it’s
        valid. The South African ID is validated by matching the following
        criteria.
      <p>
        The total number of digits must be 13 and the format is [YYMMDD] [GGGG]
        [C] [A] [Z]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>[YYMMDD] for the ID holder’s date of birth</li>
        <li>
          [GGGG] for ID holder’s gender. 0000 – 4999 for female and 5000 – 9999
          for male.
        </li>
        <li>
          [C] is their citizenship status. 0 is a South African Citizen and 1 is
          a permanent resident.
        </li>
        <li>
          [A] can be any number but, at the time of writing this post, is
          usually an 8.
        </li>
        <li>
          [Z] is a check digit which uses the Luhn Algorithm to validate the
          rest of the ID number.
        </li>
      </ul>
